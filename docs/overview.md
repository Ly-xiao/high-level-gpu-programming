# Overview

 Many curent HPC systems are heterogeneous  a mix of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. Creating code that delivers optimal performance while remaining portable across a diverse set of platforms can be expensive and time-consuming to achieve the best result.  
 To address this challenge, cross-platform portability ecosystems typically offer a higher-level abstraction layer, which presents a convenient and portable programming model for parallel programming in shared memory environments. These ecosystems can significantly streamline the process of developing, maintaining, and deploying accelerated applications. Their primary objective is to achieve performance portability by allowing developers to write a single-source application. In C++ two (among many) notable   cross-platform portability ecosystems are**Kokkos** and **SYCL**.

 **SYCL** is an open standard specification published by the Khronos Group. This specification defines a unified C++ programming layer that empowers developers to harness modern C++ capabilities across a diverse array of heterogeneous devices. By utilizing support from OpenCL and various other backends, SYCL facilitates parallel execution on a wide spectrum of hardware, encompassing CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs, AI accelerators, and custom-designed chips. This capability forms the basis for the development of efficient, portable, and reusable middleware libraries and applications.

 **Kokkos** Core is a C++ programming framework designed to enable the development of high-performance applications that can run seamlessly across various prominent HPC platforms. This framework offers abstractions for concurrent code execution and efficient data management. Kokkos is specifically engineered to address the challenges posed by intricate node architectures featuring multiple memory levels and diverse execution resources. Currently, Kokkos supports a range of backend programming models, including CUDA, HIP, SYCL, HPX, OpenMP, and C++ threads, with ongoing development efforts to incorporate additional backend options.
