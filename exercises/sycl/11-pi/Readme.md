# Computing `pi`

Starting from the mpi example of computing `pi` https://github.com/csc-training/mpi-introduction/edit/main/parallel-pi/solution/pi.cpp and using this Intel  example https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/compile-and-run-mpi-programs-using-dpcpp-language.html construct a code which computes the value of `pi` using 2 gpus, with 1 GPU device per MPI task.
